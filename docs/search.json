However, I then realized that organizing those files is not an easy task for me. And, in fact, I did not want to be worried about that! All I want was a simple tool that allows me to write some text and maybe provide some images, and then tool takes care of the rest by rendering it to HTML format. I knew about quarto and I realized that it has supports for building blogs! I can write stuff in MarkDown and Quarto takes care of the rest!"
