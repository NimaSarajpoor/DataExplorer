    "text": "Why did I choose quarto for building my blog?\nI was looking for a simple way to publish posts. I tried to learn a little bit of HTML and CSS. But, I realized that organizing those files is not an easy task for me. And, in fact, I did not want to be worried about that! All I want was a simple tool that allows me to write some text and maybe provide some images, and then the tool can take care of the rest by rendering it to HTML format. There exists different static site generator, like HUGO or ASTRO. And maybe there are better choice. I decided to go with quarto because I was a bit familiar with it already and its guide for setting up blog was very straightforward."

    "text": "Interest Rates\nLet’s start with a quick example: Do you agree to pay $1000 today, and, in return, receive $950 today? Of course you don’t! You are basically losing $50 here! But… what if you need to pay it one year from now? This might be okay. A $1000 in one year from now should be worth less than $1000 today. So, it sounds to be fair to discount the (future) $1000 to calculate the amount that is received today.\nThe interest rate, \\(r\\), is a rate of return that reflects the relationship between differently dated cash flows. In our example above, $500 is the compensation required for paying $10000 one year from now.\n\\(r = \\frac{500}{9500} = 0.0526\\)\nSo, in this example, the rate of return is 5.26%."
