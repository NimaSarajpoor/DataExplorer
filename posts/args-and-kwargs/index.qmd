What are *args and **kwargs in Python?

I guess you have seen this syntax in Python functions, but you may not know what it means. Let's taka a look at it!

```{python}
def my_function(name, *args, **kwargs):
    print("args:", args)
    print("kwargs:", kwargs)    

    return

my_function('nima', 1, 2, 3, a=4, b=5)
```


As you can see, `args` is a variable of type `tuple`, and `kwargs` is a variable of type `dict`. Note that `args` can take any number of positional arguments, and `kwargs` can take any number of keyword arguments.
