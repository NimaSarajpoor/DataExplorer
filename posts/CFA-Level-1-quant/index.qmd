## Introduction

What is the value of an asset? It basically reflects the worth of a stream of future cash flows. 
To determine the value of an asset, we need to understand the "time value of money". 
The "time value of money" deals with equivalence relationships between cash flows with different dates.


## Interest Rates

Let's start with a quick example: Do you agree to pay $1000 today, and, in return, receive $950 today? 
Of course you don't! You are basically losing $50 here! But...  what if you need to pay it one year from now? 
This might be okay. A $1000 in one year from now should be worth less than $1000 today. So, it sounds to be fair 
to discount the (future) $1000 to calculate the amount that is received today. 

The interest rate, $r$, is a rate of return that reflects the relationship between differently dated cash flows. 
In our example above, $500 is the compensation required for paying $10000 one year from now. 

$r = \frac{500}{9500} = 0.0526$

So, in this example, the rate of return is 5.26%.
