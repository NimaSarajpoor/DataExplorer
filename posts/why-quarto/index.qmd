Why did I choose quarto for building my blog?

I was looking for a simple way to publish posts. I tried to learn a little bit of HTML and CSS. 
But, I realized that organizing those files is not an easy task for me. And, in fact, I did not want to be worried about that!
All I want was a simple tool that allows me to write some text and maybe provide some images, 
and then the tool can take care of the rest by rendering it to HTML format. 
There exists different static site generator, like HUGO or ASTRO. And maybe there are better choice. 
I decided to go with quarto because I was a bit familiar with it already and its guide for setting up blog was very 
straightforward.
